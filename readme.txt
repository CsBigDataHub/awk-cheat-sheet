This is the AWK cheat sheet. AWK is a fun language to know. It allows you to
do various string processing tasks on Unix quickly. I created this cheat sheet
when I was learning AWK some years ago.

I explain a lot more about how and why I created it in my article "Awk, Nawk
and GNU Awk Cheat Sheet". This article can be read here:

I'm sorry that I used Microsoft Word to create it, but I was not proficient in
LaTeX back then.
